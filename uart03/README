See the top level README file for more information on documentation
and how to run these programs.

So for my pi3, the MPIDR_EL1 register lower 2 bits indicate which
core.

So I sort the cores out and have them each do something different.

As with other examples in this directory you have to not only have
a kernel7.img (uart03.bin in this case) but you have to have config.txt

arm_control=0x200
kernel_old=1
disable_commandline_tags=1

http://elinux.org/RPiconfig describes each of these

arm_control=0x200  processor in 64 bit mode
kernel_old=1       load kernel7.img to 0x0000 instead of 0x8000
disable_commandline_tags=1  do not write over my program with atags
